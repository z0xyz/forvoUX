**TODO**
- [ ]  Enable a more convenient , encompassing way to choose which recording to listen to .
- [ ]  Any possible code refinements .
    - [ ] Refine the cases within the function body with potentially a convenient formula for numbering .
- [ ] ~~drawing little transparent square around play buttons to give a visual indicator of which sound will be played .~~
    - [ ] ~~these square should be transparent with little square at the perimeter .~~
    - [ ] ~~the movement of the highlighting square should be assigned with the jklh keys (with home row movement) .~~
    - [ ] ~~when the square moves around -on long pages with numerous pronunciation recordings , the page has to somehow have slight movement accordingly .~~

**Installation**

**Usage**

*   pressing \<space\> will play the primary pronunciation .
*   pressing w,a,s,d keys to move the transparent box around the page to highlight the desired recording , then pressing \<Space\> bar to play it .
*   pressing \<q\> -for [q]uery- will highlight the search box , while pressing \<Shift-q\> will erase the search box content then highlight it .

**TODO**
- [ ]  Enable a more convenient , encompassing way to choose which recording to listen to .
- [ ]  Any possible code refinements .
    - [ ] Refine the cases within the function body with potentially a convenient formula for numbering .
~~- [ ]  drawing little transparent square around play buttons to give a visual indicator of which sound will be played .~~
~~    - [ ] these square should be transparent with little square at the perimeter .~~
~~    - [ ] the movement of the highlighting square should be assigned with the jklh keys (with home row movement) .~~
~~    - [ ] when the square moves around -on long pages with numerous pronunciation recordings , the page has to somehow have slight movement accordingly .~~

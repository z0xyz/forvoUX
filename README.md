**TODO**
- [ ]  Enable a more convenient , encompassing way to choose which recording to listen to .
- [ ]  Any possible code refinements .
    - [ ] Refine the cases within the function body with potentially a convenient formula for numbering .
- [ ]  drawing little transparent square around play buttons to give a visual indicator of which sound will be played .
    - [ ] these square should be transparent with little square at the perimeter .
    - [ ] the movement of the highlighting square should be assigned with the jklh keys (with home row movement) .
    - [ ] when the square moves around -on long pages with numerous pronunciation recordings , the page has to somehow have slight movement accordingly .
